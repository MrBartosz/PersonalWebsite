                        After completing my studies in Management and Production Engineering, I decided to pursue a career in the construction industry. Through two intense years of work and skill development, I came to realize that my growth prospects in this field were limited.
                        I refuse to accept the idea that reaching the pinnacle of my career would occur by the age of 30-35.
                        In 2021, I decided to start learning front-end development. The ability to create, enhance, and enjoy the final results is highly satisfying and keeps me motivated to constantly improve. I am a highly ambitious individual who takes pleasure in the opportunity for continuous growth.
                        <br/>From a young age, I competed on football fields, which taught me how to cope with stress. Unfortunately, an injury thwarted my plans related to sports, but I channeled my addiction to healthy competition into other areas of my life.
